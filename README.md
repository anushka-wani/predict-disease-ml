# HealthWise

## Overview
HealthWise is a machine learning-based disease prediction system that allows users to input symptoms and receive predictions about possible diseases. It provides symptom descriptions and recommended precautions to help users take appropriate action.

## Features
- Predicts diseases based on user-input symptoms.  
- Provides a detailed description of predicted diseases.  
- Suggests precautions for the predicted diseases.  
- Uses a trained Random Forest model for predictions.  
- Built using Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly web interface.  

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd HealthWise
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Create and copy `config.toml` file into your device's Streamlit folder to ensure smooth execution.
4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Model Details
- The disease prediction model is built using Random Forest.
- The model is trained using labeled symptom data from `dataset.csv`.
- The trained model is saved as `disease_prediction_model.pkl`.
